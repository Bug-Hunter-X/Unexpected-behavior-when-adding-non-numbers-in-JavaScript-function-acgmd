This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to implicit type coercion and the addition operator.  The `bug.js` file contains code with a potential issue. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved type checking to address this issue.  The error occurs when non-numeric values are passed into the function causing unexpected results. The solution adds explicit type checking and appropriate handling to resolve this.
